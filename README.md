Performing Analysis Kickstarter data to uncover trends
### Module 1 Challenge

Three main conclusions from the data and states limitations of the dataset and suggestions:

1)	Louise’s play Fever came close came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time, after the trend analysis it appears that the parent category of theatre/plays were the most popular genre preferred by the masses compared to any other category.


2)	The launch month seems to be  an important factor, closer to May through August seems very favorable, the reasoning could be it’s closer to summer, people are more enthusiastic to go out to do activities coming out from a long winter/spring.


3)	Financially speaking, projects which set a limit of $5,000 were really successful. From there on, the more budget the success of projects decreased. Although there is a slight increase in success around the $35,000 mark, the sample size is really small to predict a resounding trend.


While these results are provide great insights, a more detailed analysis is advised to include variance to determine & remove any and all outliers with IQR rule with all the 3 conditions mention above. After post processing visualizing distributions using Box Plots & possible extrapolating data to predict future trends would be a great insight  for Louise’s future fundraising.
